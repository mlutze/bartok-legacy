# Base Rules

_The minimal fundamental rules of Bartok._

The dealer deals 5 cards to each player at the beginning of the round.
The dealer draws the top card from the deck and lays it on the table to begin the pile.
Play begins from the left of the dealer and continues clockwise.
On their turn, a player must either:
- play a card from their hand on the pile such that either the suit or the value of the card matches that of the top of the pile, or
- draw a card from the deck.

Either of these actions ends the player's turn.
At any point, a player may accuse another of having broken a rule. Play pauses immediately.
- If the player is found guilty of breaking a rule by consensus of players at the table, then the player must draw a card.
- If the player is not found guilty of breaking a rule, then the accusing player must draw a card.

In either case, after the accusor or guilty player has drawn a card, play continues where it was paused.

If at any point, a player has no cards in their hand, then they win the round.

At the end of a round, the player having least recently contributed a rule must describe a rule to be added to the game for all future rounds.
The rule must be general, applying equally to all players.

# Developed Rules

_Rules added as a result of playing Bartok._

## Jokers Wild
_Added by Matt, 14 Aug 2023_

4 Jokers are added to the deck.
They are considered wild:
they may be played on any card and any card may be played on them.

## Trap Card
_Added by Andreas, 14 Aug 2023_

On your turn, rather than playing or drawing a card, you may set a trap card face-down.
You may only have one trap card at a time.
You may play the trap card at any time.
The trap card must change the suit (playing a Joker or playing on a Joker qualifies).
If you play the trap card on your turn, your turn ends.

## Prime Sequence
_Added by Xavier, 14 Aug 2023_

When you would play a card on your turn,
you may instead play a collection of cards such that:
- the first card alone would be valid to play
- the remaining cards are in increasing order
- all the cards have prime values, where a Jack, Queen, King, and Ace have the values 11, 12, 13, and 14, respectively.

## Give 2
_Added by Jonathan, 14 Aug 2023_

When you play a 2, you must designate two other players:
- a Giver
- a Receiver

the Giver selects two cards from their hand and gives them to the Receiver.

## Hidden Trap Card
_Added by Matt, 14 Aug 2023_

You may not look at your trap card once you have set it.

## Bartok
_Added by Mathias, 21 Aug 2023_

If you begin to have 1 card, then you must say "Bartok" before someone next plays a card.

## Aces Reverse
_Added by Xavier, 21 Aug 2023_

If you play an Ace, then turn order is reversed.

## Toktok
_Added by Jonathan, 21 Aug 2023_

If you begin to have two cards, then you must say "Toktok" before someone next plays a card.

## Delay of Game
_Added by Matt, 21 Aug 2023_

You may at any point raise your hand to indicate that the current player is taking too long.
If the majority of players raise their hands, the current player draws a penalty card.

## Root Groups
_Added by Mathias, 21 Aug 2023_

When you would play a card on your turn,
you may instead play a collection of $n$ cards of the same value $v$ such that:
- the first card alone would be valid to play
- $v = i^n$ for some integer $i$

where the value of an Ace is 1.

## Royal Family
_Added by Xavier, 21 Aug 2023_

When you would play a card on your turn,
you may instead play a collection of cards such that:
- the first card is either a King or Queen
- the first card alone would be valid to play
- the collection includes both a King and Queen
- the collection optionally includes an additional card if the King and Queen are of the same suit
